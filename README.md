# Project1
Project 1 of Data Science bootcamp -- looking at youtube data


You must run the Cleaning notebook BEFORE running Main. Inside cleaning, we are saving the data to a csv named TotalData.csv
this file is too large to push to github without having to download LFS, so we have decided not to push it. Therefore, run Cleaning so that TotalData.csv is stored in your remote location, and from then on you can run Main without running Cleaning, as it will now be in your
remote repo.

REMEMBER NOT TO PUSH TOTALDATA.CSV!!!
